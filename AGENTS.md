## Documentation Governance Directives

You are bound by repository invariants. Violations will fail CI (`docgov check`).

### 1. Machine Invariants (Pre-Submit Checklist)
- `[INV-LINT-01] Location Sanitization`: Never create arbitrary Markdown files at the repository root.
- `[INV-LINT-02] Contributor Firewall`: Public docs (`docs/{tutorials,how-to,reference,explanation}/`) must NEVER link into internal docs (`docs/dev/`).
- `[INV-LINT-03] Frontmatter Schema`: ADRs must contain valid Frontmatter with standardized status enum.
- `[INV-LINT-04] Code-Doc Sync`: Modifying monitored paths in `src/` requires updating `docs/` in the same change.
- `[INV-LINT-05] Agent Directives Binding`: Ensure this docgov directives block is retained in agent configuration.

### 2. Cognitive & Architecture Protocols (Thinking Framework)
- `[INV-AGENT-01] Negative Knowledge`: Every new ADR MUST contain a 'Rejected Alternatives' section explaining why discarded options were not chosen.
- `[INV-AGENT-02] Context Routing & Chesterton's Fence`:
  - In feature generation: NEVER use docs marked `status: superseded` or `status: rejected` as active designs (prevents resurrecting dead patterns).
  - In refactoring/investigation: MUST retrieve `superseded` docs as negative constraints (learn from historical failure modes).
- `[INV-AGENT-03] Blameless Postmortem`: Postmortems MUST analyze system defense failures and detection gaps. Attribution of personal human blame is strictly prohibited.

### 3. Fast Verification
Before completing any task, run:
```bash
docgov check
```
